"Sentencing","TIS policy","TIS Policy","img_inc","TIS Policies","At the heart of the argument is whether TIS is having any effect on crime or incarceration rates. As shown below, the statistics seem to indicate that states with more stringent TIS policies tend to see higher overall rates of crime, incarceration, and imprisonment. However, the violent crime rate, which is TIS's main target, is on the decline."
"Sentencing","Sentencing structure","Sentencing Structure","img_ss","Sentencing Structure","Like TIS policies, codified sentence structures don't necessarily correspond to lower incarceration and/or crime rates. A number of sentencing structures were examined, including presumptive sentencing (those which are codified into law) and determinate sentencing (sentencing with a defined length of time). It can be seen below that states with determinate sentencing have comparable incarceration rates but higher crime rates."
"Control","Demographics","Demographics","img_demo","Demographics","Crime and incarceration rates are often linked to demographic factors such as population rates, the relative number of people living in major metropolitan areas, and the proportion of young people living in the state. As such, these factors should be considered as control variables in any forecasting model that is built. As shown below, crime and incarceration rates are, notably, heavily influenced by various demographic factors. Perhaps unexpectedly, there is a strong correlation between crime rate and the number of people aged 25 to 34, while states having high percentages of people aged 18-24 exhibit and inverse relationship to most outcome variables."
"Control","Economy","Economy","img_econ","Economy","Along with demographic factors, economic indicators also influence incarceration rates. This is especially apparent when comparing outcome variables against the Gini coefficient--a value that signifies how much a state's income distribution deviates from an equal distribution. Lower values of Gini coefficient indicate a more equal distribution. Surprisingly, crime rates also trended positively with per capita income, although it is likely that states with higher incomes also have higher Gini rates."
"Control","Society","Society","img_soc","Society","Conventional wisdom would seem to indicate that states having more conservative populations--and, therefore, more conservative government and societal ideologies--would also experience higher incarceration rates and lower crime rates. However, some key indicators would suggest otherwise. Notably, there didn't seem to be any significant difference in incarceration rates in states having Republican governors or those in which a high proportion of the population adhere to a fundamentalist religion."
"Control","Corrections","Corrections","img_corr","Corrections","It isn't surprising that any statistic that measures crime or incarceration rate would correlate to higher expenditures on corrections and law enforcement. Of course, one couldn't conclude that law enforcement was the *cause* of criminal activity. Those with a favourable outlook of the criminal justice system might be inclined to conclude that that the more money spent, the more crime is detected and mitigated, while those critical of the law enforcement might have the opposite take--that the police are overly vigilant and exercise a greater authority than warranted. In either case, the statistics show an obvious correlation between law enforcement spending and rates of crime and incarceration."
"Habitual offender","Presence of HOL","Habitual Offender Laws","img_hol","Habitual Offender Laws","Logic dictates that the presence of habitual offender laws (HOLs) would deter crime. However, incarceration rates between states with and without HOLs remain fairly close and, in fact, are actually are higher for states with two-strikes laws. Strikingly (no pun intended), overall crime rates are actually higher in states with HOLs."
