The study found that States with a combination of determinate sentencing
(abolition of discretionary parole release) and presumptive sentencing
guidelines had lower incarceration rates and a smaller growth in these
rates than other States. These policies had to be implemented in
combination in order to have this effect. States with separate time-served
requirements for violent offenders had higher incarceration rates than
States without such requirements, and States with a higher number of
sentencing extensions for drug offenses had comparatively higher
incarceration rates. Also, States with a higher number of mandatory
sentencing laws had higher incarceration rates; however, no link was found
between laws that increased prison sentences for second-time or third-time
offenders and the incarceration rate. Factors other than law and policy
that increased incarceration rates were higher property-crime rates, larger
minority populations, a higher unemployment rate, more revenue per capita,
a higher number of arrests for drug offenses, a Republican governor, a
higher number of religiously conservative residents, and a higher number of
politically conservative residents. States with higher income per capita
and more generous welfare benefits had lower incarceration rates. Using a
pooled time-series cross-sectional design and using data for all 50 States
obtained from several government sources, the study isolated the influence
of sentencing and corrections policies on changes in State incarceration
rates between 1975 and 2002. The analysis controlled for a number of
demographic, economic, ideological, and crime-related variables.
