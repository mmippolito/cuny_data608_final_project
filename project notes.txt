intro
list the benefits of FL and early FL acquisition, ask where the US stands compared to the rest of the world

use FLE report pdf 2017 to show stats on percentage of schools that offer FL programs in k-12
	https://www.americancouncils.org/sites/default/files/FLE-report-June17.pdf (p 26 for k-8)
show the number of 9-12 students taking a FL
	https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d09/tables/dt09_056.asp
possibly use FLE K-8 data to extrapolate from the 400 schools surveyed to estimate K-8 FL programs offered nationwide
	https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d09/tables/dt09_034.asp
	https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d09/tables/dt09_035.asp
use the foreign language learning statistics xlsx sheet to show the pct of primary, middle, and secondary students enrolled in FL programs in Europe
	https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Foreign_language_learning_statistics

other ideas
show the pcts of US students taking FLs over time
show how rates of FL offerings differ based on income level of school districts

truth in sentencing

Amount of time served 44% in 1996 (avg 30 months)
Parole boards decided when they could be released, not applied consistently
Public pressure to enforce full sentences
Bill Clinton signed truth-in-sentencing laws into effect in 1994 with the Violent Crime Control and Enforcement Act

argument for:
deterrent
justice for criminal
no bias; everyone gets same sentence

argument against:
prison overcrowding
cost of incarcerating prisoners longer
extra cost could be spent on prevention programs
lack of incentive/positive reinforcement for good behaviour
